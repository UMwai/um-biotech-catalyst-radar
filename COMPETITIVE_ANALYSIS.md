## Our 5 Core Differentiators

### 1. **Price: 80% Cheaper** ($29 vs $150/month)

**Why it matters**:
- BioPharmCatalyst = 5 months of our service
- Retail traders have limited budgets
- $29 is "impulse buy" territory, $150 requires justification

**Our positioning**:
> "BioPharmCatalyst is a Ferrari. We're a Tesla Model 3 — 80% of the performance at 20% of the price."

**Messaging**:
- Landing page: "Same data, 1/5 the price"
- FAQ: "We automate what they manually curate"
- Tagline: "Professional biotech catalyst tracking for retail traders"

---

### 2. **Simplicity: 10 Features vs 100+**

**BioPharmCatalyst overwhelm**:
- 15+ filters
- 50+ data columns
- Complex watchlists
- Advanced screeners
- Institutional features (compliance, audit trails)

**Our focused approach**:
| Core Feature | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| Small-cap filter (<$5B) | These actually move 20-50% on news |
| Phase 2/3 trials | Binary events with run-up potential |
| 30-60 day window | Optimal entry timing |
| Price charts | Visual confirmation of run-up |
| Ticker mapping | No manual lookup needed |

**User experience**:
- BioPharmCatalyst: 30-minute learning curve
- Us: <2 minutes to first insight

**Messaging**:
> "We show you what matters. Nothing more."

---

### 3. **Small-Cap Specialization**

**BioPharmCatalyst covers everything**:
- Large caps (Pfizer, Merck) - minimal price movement
- Mid caps - moderate movement
- Small caps - high volatility (our sweet spot)

**Our niche**:
- **Only <$5B market cap**
- These stocks move 20-50% pre-catalyst
- 10x more retail trader interest

**Why small caps matter**:
```
Pfizer ($200B cap):    5% move = $10B market cap change
Small biotech ($1B):   50% move = $500M market cap change

Retail trader impact:
$1,000 investment in Pfizer: +$50 (5%)
$1,000 investment in small cap: +$500 (50%)
```

**Messaging**:
> "We focus on small caps because that's where retail traders make money."

---

### 4. **100% Automated Data Pipeline**

**Our automation**:

| Completion date change | +48-72 hours | +24 hours |
