# Distribution & Subscriber Acquisition Strategy

> **Goal**: Acquire 100 subscribers in 90 days (0 → $2,000+ MRR)

## Overview

**Challenge**: Nobody knows we exist
**Solution**: Go where biotech traders already are (Reddit, Twitter, Discord)
**Budget**: $0-500 (scrappy growth)

---

## Target Customer Profile

### Primary: The Active Retail Biotech Trader

**Demographics**:
- Age: 25-45
- Income: $50K-150K/year
- Portfolio size: $10K-100K
- Trading frequency: Weekly
- Experience: 2-5 years trading

**Psychographics**:
- Reads r/Biotechplays daily
- Follows biotech traders on Twitter
- Uses ThinkorSwim or Robinhood
- Believes in catalyst-driven trading
- Frustrated with manual research

**Pain points**:
- Spends 5-10 hours/week researching catalysts
- Misses opportunities (finds out after run-up)
- Overwhelmed by ClinicalTrials.gov complexity
- Can't afford $150/month BioPharmCatalyst
- Wants automated alerts, not spreadsheets

**Jobs to be done**:
- "Find biotech run-ups before they happen"
- "Stop wasting weekends on research"
- "Get in before the hype"

---

## Acquisition Channels (Ranked by Priority)

### Channel 1: **Reddit** (Primary - 60% of effort)

**Why Reddit**:
- 500K+ biotech traders active on r/Biotechplays, r/stocks
- High intent (actively seeking trading ideas)
- Free to post
- Viral potential (good posts get 1K+ upvotes)
- Community trusts user recommendations over ads

|-----------|---------|----------|----------|
| r/Biotechplays | 80K | High | Weekly catalyst posts |
| r/stocks | 5M | Medium | Monthly "catalyst watch" |
| r/pennystocks | 2M | High | Small-cap focus |
| r/StockMarket | 3M | Medium | Educational posts |
| r/wallstreetbets | 15M | Very High | Meme posts (risky) |

**Content Strategy**:

#### Post Type 1: **Weekly Catalyst Reports** (Value-first)
```
Title: "30 Biotech Catalysts in the Next 30 Days (Free Report)"

Body:
Here are the Phase 2/3 trials completing in December 2025:

1. $EXBT - Phase 3 Oncology (Dec 15) - $2.5B market cap
2. $RXDX - Phase 2 Rare Disease (Dec 22) - $1.2B market cap
3. ...

```

**Expected results**:

- 50-200 comments
- 100-500 clicks to website
- 10-50 trial signups (10% conversion)
- 1-5 paid subscribers (10% trial→paid)

**Frequency**: Weekly (every Monday morning)

---

#### Post Type 2: **Live Catalyst Updates** (Urgency)
```
Title: "$BIOTECH just announced Phase 3 results in 14 days 🚀"

Body:
Just saw this on ClinicalTrials.gov:

$BIOTECH (market cap: $1.8B)
- Phase 3: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
- Expected completion: January 8, 2025
- Enrollment: 450 patients
- Price today: $32.50

Historical run-up: 20-40% in 2-4 weeks before data

Chart: [screenshot of 6-month chart]

I track these daily on my tool: [link]
Free trial if you want alerts like this.

(Not financial advice)
```

**Expected results**:
- 200-1,000 upvotes
- 20-100 comments
- 50-200 clicks
- 5-20 signups

**Frequency**: 2-3x/week (when exciting catalyst appears)

---

#### Post Type 3: **Educational Posts** (Authority building)
```
Title: "How I find biotech run-ups before WSB does (step-by-step)"

Body:
1. Go to ClinicalTrials.gov
2. Filter for Phase 2/3 trials
3. Look for completion dates 30-60 days out
4. Check market cap (<$5B for volatility)
5. Check price action (consolidation = bullish)
6. Enter position 2-4 weeks before catalyst

I automated steps 1-4 because it takes 10 hours/week manually.

**Expected results**:

- 100-500 comments
- 200-1,000 clicks
- 20-100 signups

**Frequency**: Once/month (high-effort, high-value)

**Reddit Growth Tactics**:

1. **Engage first, promote later**
   - Comment on 10 posts/day in target subreddits
   - Build karma (need 500+ to post in r/wallstreetbets)
   - Establish credibility before promoting

2. **Timing matters**
   - Post Monday 8-10 AM ET (highest engagement)
   - Avoid weekends (lower activity)
   - Follow earnings calendar (post before big weeks)

3. **No direct sales**
   - Always lead with free value (catalyst list)
   - Mention tool casually ("I built this for myself")
   - Link in comments, not title

4. **Handle criticism gracefully**
   - "This is spam!" → "Fair feedback, just trying to help"
   - "BioPharmCatalyst is better" → "Great tool! We're 87% cheaper if budget matters"
   - "Why should I pay?" → "7-day free trial, see if it saves you time"
